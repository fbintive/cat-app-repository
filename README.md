# Reflections

Things to implment if I had more time:
- UI framework (preferably vue or react) - that would allow for easy reactivity and modularity as well as state management solutions
- css preprocessor - current implementation is basic and doesn't allow for nesting, using convenient functionalities like & or mixins
- nicer looking layout - I'm not the best freestyler, so next time I would look for something more eye-pleasing
- media query - task didn't mention anyting about other devices than desktop, but in real life I would probably go with mobile-first approach
